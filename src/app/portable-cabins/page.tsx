          <p className="text-[#5a6c7e] leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Our pre-fab cabins are one of the most popular structures we sell. These buildings have many possible uses, such as a hunting cabin, home office, &ldquo;she-shed,&rdquo; &ldquo;man-cave,&rdquo; or even a tiny home. While we do not sell tiny homes, several of our customers have done the necessary work to properly finish out one of the cabins pursuant to their local building codes.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[#5a6c7e] leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Our cabins start out as small as 8ft x 10ft and come as big as 16ft x 40ft (depending on location.) We offer three basic styles of cabins: Side Porch Cabins, Playhouse Cabins, and Deluxe Cabins. Each building has its own unique advantage.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[#5a6c7e] leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The Side Porch Cabin is what some refer to as a &ldquo;his &amp; hers&rdquo; cabin since it has a work area to be used for gardening or other uses as well as a large storage area. The Playhouse Cabin comes with 4ft of porch as well a house-style walk-in door and three 2ft x 3ft windows. Our Deluxe Cabin comes with up to 8ft of porch as well as three bay windows and a house-style walk-in door. All three of our cabins come in either a Utility version or a Lofted version.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[#5a6c7e] leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The benefit of the Utility version is the ability to have 8ft sidewalls while the benefit of the Lofted version is the built-in overhead lofted storage.
