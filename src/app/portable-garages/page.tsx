            Protect Your Investment With A Portable Garage&hellip;

            Often times adding a garage onto an existing home or having a free-standing garage built can be cost-prohibitive. By the time you&apos;ve hired an architect and priced out the materials, the dream of owning a garage can seem out of reach. This is where a portable garage from Backyard Outfitters comes in! Whether you need to store an antique car or want to have space to work on your vehicle, one of these portable garages might just be the solution you are looking for. Our buildings are built to exacting standards, in the spirit of Mennonite craftsmanship, and with the highest quality materials. One unique feature of our portable garages is that&hellip;well&hellip;they are portable.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[#5a6c7e] leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Our garages start out as small as 8ft x 10ft and come as big as 16ft x 40ft (depending on location.) We offer two basic styles of garages: a Utility Garage and a Lofted Garage. Each building has its own unique advantages. After construction, they are delivered to your location and set up where you&apos;d like them to sit. **Some placement restrictions might apply depending on a number of factors. In the event you ever moved to a new home or needed to relocate one of these structures, you can contact your dealer to obtain the delivery company&apos;s contact information. They can assist you in helping get your structure moved.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[#5a6c7e] leading-relaxed mb-4">
            We have seen many different uses when customers purchase our portable garages&hellip;including car storage, home office, homeschool room, crafting room, and so much more!
