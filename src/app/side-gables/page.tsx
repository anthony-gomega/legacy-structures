            Our Side Gable Buildings at Legacy Structures are a smart alternative to traditional side-entry utility sheds. Designed with the roof gable running along the length of the building, these sheds are ideal when placing the long side of the structure toward your yard, driveway, or property line&mdash;especially when you want the roofline to match the visual flow of your space. Not only are they functional, but the center height provides extra headroom and storage flexibility.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[#5a6c7e] leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Available in multiple widths and lengths, Side Gables can be customized with your choice of siding, roof style, and paint or stain color. Each one includes either a single or double barn door depending on the size, and comes built to last using quality materials. Whether you&apos;re storing lawn equipment, tools, or just need more space, these sheds are a stylish and durable solution.
