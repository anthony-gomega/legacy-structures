          Looking for an affordable way to have storage in your backyard or at your business? Look no further than our Rent-to-Own program! With low upfront costs and affordable monthly payments, this program is perfect for customers who either don&apos;t want to pay cash or can&apos;t afford to pay cash for a backyard barn.
        </p>

        <h2 className="!text-black">Simple and Affordable Pricing</h2>
        <p>
          Our program is simple: just choose the storage building you want and pay us the first month&apos;s rent and a small security deposit, and we deliver it to you. There&apos;s no credit check required, and the rental agreement is on a month-to-month basis, meaning you have the flexibility to turn in the building at any time for any reason (after the initial period of 1-4 months). Plus, if you make all consecutive monthly payments in accordance with your rental agreement, you&apos;ll own the building! And you can pay it off at any time with no prepayment penalty.
        </p>

        <h2 className="!text-black">No Credit Check Required</h2>
        <p>
          Even if you have the money needed to buy one of our barns outright, our Rent-to-Own program is still a great option. In addition to very easy pricing, one major advantage of our program is that renting a shed does not affect your credit rating at all. With NO Credit Checks, all you have to do is pay a small security deposit plus the first month&apos;s rent, and we&apos;ll deliver a building to your location (free delivery within 30 miles of a dealer). From then on, you make all consecutive monthly payments in accordance with your rental agreement and the building is yours! You won&apos;t find a cheaper or more attainable Rent-To-Own plan anywhere.
        </p>

        <h2 className="!text-black">Customizable Options Available</h2>
        <p>
          We believe that everyone should have access to affordable and convenient storage options, which is why we offer multiple building styles and finishes to choose from. If you want a custom barn built, you are in luck!!! We have a{" "}
