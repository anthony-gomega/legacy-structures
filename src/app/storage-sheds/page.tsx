            Our storage sheds are built using the best quality materials and exacting standards resulting in a quality building that will last for years to come. We offer three basic versions of our storage sheds: Utility Sheds, Metal Utility Sheds, and our Utility Dormer sheds. Each shed has its own unique value:
          </p>
          <p className="text-[#5a6c7e] leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Our basic Utility Shed comes with the option to have either T1-11 pressure-treated siding or LP Smart&#8482; Panel siding. You can choose either option at no additional charge. The Metal Shed uses the same construction process but with 29 gauge metal siding instead of wood. The Utility Dormer Shed is also made with T1-11 pressure-treated siding or LP Smart&#8482; Panel siding but it includes a dormer which brings in a significant amount of natural light to the structure.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[#5a6c7e] leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Our Utility Shed can be built with 8ft sidewalls, while the Utility Dormer Shed comes with 7ft sidewalls. Our Metal Sheds are built on 6ft sidewalls. Whatever storage needs you have, one of our storage sheds is sure to fit the bill.
